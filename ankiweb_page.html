<b># AnkiApp Importer</b>

An add-on to import decks from the copycat AnkiApp (https://www.ankiapp.com/).

It appears that AnkiApp started to paywall the deck export feature (see https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/ocbhry/help_to_bypass_ankiapps_paywall_for_deck_export/). So you can no longer export a zip of your cards <a href="https://www.ankiapp.com/support/solutions/ddcf01b0/can-i-export-my-flashcards-from-ankiapp-/">without paying</a>.

This add-on salvages the cards from the SQLite database and was inspired by the Reddit post linked above. It imports cards, decks, note types, and media files.

<b>## How to Use</b>

<ul><li>Go to <b>Tools > Import From AnkiApp</b> and choose AnkiApp's database file (<code>C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\AnkiApp\databases\file__0</code> on Windows; see the Reddit post above for more info).</li><li>You should see the message "Imported successfully."</li></ul>
